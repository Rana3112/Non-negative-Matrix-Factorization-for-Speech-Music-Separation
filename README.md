## ðŸ§­ Overview

This repository implements **speech and music source separation** from a single-channel audio mixture using **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** and **Wiener filtering**.

The project explores and reproduces the method described in Abdali & NaserSharif (2017), extending the standard NMF by incorporating:

- **Source-dependent decomposition ranks**
- **Temporal continuity regularization**
- **Spectral masking (Wiener filter) post-processing**

This approach enables effective separation of speech and music in mixed audio signals.

## ðŸŽ§ Problem Description

Single-channel **source separation** aims to extract individual sources (speech, music) from one mixed signal without access to isolated recordings.
